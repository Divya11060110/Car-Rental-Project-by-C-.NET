# Car-Rental-Project-by-C-.NET
I have created a standalone Car Rental application using C# .NET

I have used the C# programming language to create a Rental Car System Project. Once an admin user logs in to the application, they will be able to see options for Car Registration, Customer Management, Rental, Return, and Logout.

In the Car Registration module, administrators can store unique auto-generated car registration numbers, along with details such as make, model, and availability (with options for "Yes" or "No"). Additionally, there are features to edit and delete existing car entries.

The Customer Management module includes auto-generated customer IDs, along with fields for customer name, address, and mobile number, allowing administrators to manage customer details.

To rent a car, users must first check its availability. In the Rental module, users can select a car registration number from a dropdown list to see if the car is available. They can then enter the customer ID, which will automatically display the customer's name. Additionally, the module includes fields for rental fee, date, and due date.

In the Return module, users can process car returns by selecting the car ID and customer ID. The module also includes fields for date, days elapsed, and fees. It provides functionality not only for returning the car but also for charging additional fees if the due date has passed.

The Logout option allows users to exit the application and return to the sign-in section
